A hobby project to get to know webpack, react and redux in more detail.

## Development

- `npm run build` compiles assets into `/static/dist`
- `npm run start` starts the web server using the compiled assets
- `npm run dev` compiles the assets and runs the web server, 
and adds a file watcher to hot reload changes in the browser.
